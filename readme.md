Repo where I can keep track of jQuery projects I have completed and the code that I have used.

## Memes

A meme generator using .keyup event and .text()  </br>

### How To Create Your Memes

On the right side of the screen there are three input fields. </br>

Copy the image address you want to use and enter the text where you would like it(top or bottom).  For the image you might have to bring your cursor back to the start of the image's link address for the image to refresh.

## Pocketbook

In this project I used .submit() event to make an error message appear when any of the fields in the form are filled incorrectly. </br>
More logic can be added to clear out the errors when the fields are filled out, I will continue tinkering with this project to add more functionality.
