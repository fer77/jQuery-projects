# jQuery
Repo where I can keep track of jQuery mini-projects I have completed and the code that I have used to achieve their objectives.

#### Projects
1. Memes.
2. Pocketbook
3. Threadly
4. Forecast

## Memes

This project was a lot of fun.  I had the chance to learn some new jQuery handlers, I used .keyup(), .val(), and .text() to create the effect of oneway binding(angular) to update an image and text.  The .keyup(), .val(), and .text() combo work grate for text, however for images I had to use .attr(). </br>
Take a look at the project.
### How To Create Your Memes

On the right side of the screen there are three input fields.</br>

Copy the image address you want to use and enter the text where you would like it(top or bottom).  For the image you might have to bring your cursor back to the start of the image's link address for the image to refresh, I am working to see if it is something I can fix.

## Pocketbook

Pocketbook adds an error message if any of the form fields is filled out incorrectly.  This was an easy project, where I continued to put in practice using .val() and .text() to update and retrive info from the input fields. </br>
More logic can be added to clear out the errors when the fields are filled out, I will continue tinkering with this project to add more functionality.

## Threadly
Similar to the Pocketbook project, however, here I was challenged to clear the input field after posting a comment.

## Forecast
Using the 'this' element was key in this short project.  Especially when you want to target only the element you are viewing i.e. showing the information on each day and changing the + - on each span.
